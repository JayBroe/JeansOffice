# JeansOffice


This project is an example of Hibernate ORM implementation combined
with Swing GUI framework. MySQL was used for database management system.
I present Jeans' Office - a desktop app to manage the students in the university 
by just selecting right buttons. The structure is quite simple, but from the second
hand complicated... better use Spring next time ;)

Additionally, I've perceived that a lot of tutorials about Hibernate 
shows examples uncomplete in respect of required settings 
or the are just obsolete. 

Feel free to change the code for our own experiments!
